    content: "I’m laying on my left side when my eyes begin to open. The realization that I’m fully awake creeps into my mind like the rays of sun filtering through the sides of the curtain. My first thought goes to the time, why is the alarm not going off? That’s not a good sign. I only need to move my eyes to read the old casio watch lying on my bedside table. 13 minutes to my alarm. Immediately my rule jumps into mind: if it’s not over one hour and a half, just get out of bed. I move my first muscles. As I turn to the good side of the bed I realize my back is hurting. My feet touch the ground and I feel my quads and butt hurting as well. FUCK.\nI’m thirsty. I reach for the more than half empty shaker on the table, and open my work computer. As I drink that negligible amount of water, my macbook makes that annoyingly luxurious sound and fills my room with light. I have to pee. I also have to put in my password. What should I do first? I go for the password, the computer will take time to turn on, I can optimize this way. I open the door to my room to go to the shared bathroom in my shared house. The door looks closed, I might have to wait, but as I touch the handle the wind coming from my room pushes the door open. I slide through the door and as I lock it I remember I forgot my toothbrush. I quickly open and close both doors, and then I can finally pee. Afterwards I wash my face, I should shave, I should have shaved last night. I go back to my room and put on the pants I prepared last night, when the world was moving slowly, and so was my mind. I finally reach for the curtain and pull it open, it’s cloudy, I know what that means, I will be in the office filling my glass with water, while some office Joe filling his cup with coffee, feels the room filling with awkwardness, until he can’t take it anymore and feels the need to complain about the weather, pretending to have forgotten the 3 days of sun that just went by just for the sake of killing the silence in the room. I go back and reach for the sports t-shirt I prepared. I put my password and connect to the VPN. While it’s connecting I open all the apps I know I’m gonna need, messaging, email, IDE, document writer, task manager, and they all start jumping around as I start stretching my tired legs. It’s thursday, I have to work out in the morning because tonight it’s happy hour at Shamrock and although I don’t drink, I’m looking forward to the human interactions feeding my monkey brain some much needed dopamine. I check my calendar, no meetings were scheduled since last night, big surprise. Check my messages, too many, it will take too long to answer, postponed. Check my Code Reviews dashboard, my colleague left some more comments on my code, one more day without merging this, I put all my frustration in shutting down the laptop, I slide it into the bag, put on my shoes and get out.\nI look outside and hear the noise of the railway cross closing. I look to both sides before squatting below the bar and jogging to the other side. One more day I do this and don’t die, one more day I’m right, and the old lady judging me from the otherside of the bar is wrong. I put the combination in and jump on the bike. I need to put a lot of effort in getting it moving during the first uphill, but finally I make it to the park. I start with some pull-ups and abs, and while I do so I keep thinking about the comments of my colleague, was he right? Maybe he was. What the fuck do I know. I'm starting my first set of dips as my manager responds to a message so old I need to read what I wrote twice before understanding the response, one more thing I gotta do today. During the second part of my workout I keep ruminating on the first thing I’ll do when I get to the office, not sure if I should fix my code for the small task in the sprint, work on my big project, or prepare for the presentation. As time goes by and I keep working out, I feel the looks of the people biking by becoming more and more judgemental. “Look at this guy, I wish I could work out all morning”, uhm no you don’t. “Why is he not in the office?”, fuck. They finally get to me and I jump on the bike again, heading towards the office.\nThe ride is uphill, I tell myself this is an investment, it takes me 25 minutes to to the office and only 10 minutes to go back home, at least in this case the effort is going to pay off, I’d be worried if humans were guaranteeing it, but it’s physics guaranteeing it, so I trust it. I finally get to the office and go downstairs, where the showers are. I quickly pull the clothes out of the backpack and get in the shower, I turn the knob all the way towards the blue, count to three and close my eyes. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I finally get a few minutes focusing on my physical pain rather than my existential pain, but when I get out it’s all back to normal, except my body’s thermodynamic regulation, it’s hard to be cold after that shower.\nI put on my clothes and quickly braid my hair, as I keep thinking of what I have to do when I get to my desk.\nThe braid looks like shit, oh well, gotta go. I climb the stairs two at a time as I always do, and get to my floor, I pass by an almost empty area filled with monitors and reach my usual spot, I say hi to my teammate, he has a steaming cup of coffee in his hand and his eyes are deeply focused on code, but he likes me enough to make eye contact. I appreciate the gesture by not asking stupid questions like “how are you”. I put my bag on the chair. Pull out my computer, raise the standing desk to my height before finally opening the laptop and plugging it in.\nThe day has started.",
