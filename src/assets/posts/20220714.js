	content: 'I like meeting people, I\'m not always in the mood for it, but generally that statement is true.\nWhich is why I use meet-up apps, where people organize various events for people to join. Most of those people are just like me: solo-travelers or just new to the city. \nThe first meet-up I\'ll tell you about was for software developers.\nThe appointment was in front of a building, there wasn\'t an address, just maps coordinates. I arrived an hour late, not for any particular reason, I was in my work flow and didn\'t want to interrupt it. So there I am, with nothing but some coordinates for a place where an hour ago some people met.\nI wasn\'t going to give up, the event was too perfect for me. I walked around a bit, and just around the corner was a huge glass door, on the other side was the writing of the company\'s name. \nThe name had the word \'technology\' in it, so I thought that might have been the place. \nBefore I know it I\'m reaching for the intercom, just before pressing the button I heard that voice inside my head... \'what the fuck are you doing\', luckly another voice barged in saying \'what does it matter?\' and so I rang.\nA french voice answered, didn\'t catch one word... I confidently replied with something like \'est le meet-up ici?\', he said something and hung up.\nI thought: \'well, now I can leave knowing I tried\'. But then I heard some noise from inside. The doorman getting up and coming to open the door. After a brief conversation including words from 3 different languages he walked me through a huge hall with white tall walls, and put me into an elevator, pressed a button and left.\nThe elevator\'s doors opened and I found a very french man staring at me. I was wearing my usual outfit, sport shorts that barely reached my half thigh, and a t-shirt.\nAs I walked in the room I became very aware of the dress code, after some poor conversation and a lot of weird looks from this roomful of french software developers, I sat down. The frenchman begun speaking again. His talk compared exagonal architecture with clean architecture. I understood bits and pieces here and there. \nThe ever-lasting feeling of non-belonging didn\'t matter, there was not one place in the world where I would have rather been than in that large yet unconfortable room.\nThe second evening was a bit more conventional if you will. The meet-up involved a picnic on the grass in the corner of île de la cité. I passed by many big groups, but I felt like the biggest had to have been the one from the meet-up. I almost talked to them the first time I went by, but the voice... \'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\'. I kept walking. Got to the corner of the island, Spent two minutes silencing the voice, and came around. \'Etes-vous le du le meet-up?\', I never got such a good response from such a poorly phrased question...\nThe organizer was so, so welcoming, he introduced me to everyone and I got to have 2 hours of french conversation. I could feel myself learning with every word I heard and said. Again, that was the best place I could have been in. Eventually I\'ll get to the point where the voice doesn\'t even come up, but until then, I\'ll just have to keep on fighting it.'
