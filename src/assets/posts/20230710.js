    content: "It was 2023, over 30 years ago at this point, when I made that terrible decision.\nI was 21, and I was really into writing. In fact, I was working at a big internet company as a software engineer, and even though I spent most of the time writing code at work, I was young, and bold, and felt that I had something more to say. So I spent lots of my free time writing other things: stories, blog posts, anything really.\nInspired by a discussion with some colleagues, I decided to write a dystopian story about AI. Very few simulations could predict the impact of that decision, only 4 out of 20 million simulations had a similar outcome, but it’s hard to know how accurate that is, since I can only run FutureGPT on my 1TB ram computer. If only I could afford to run it in the cloud, maybe I could get a better answer… Not that it would make any difference.\nBack then GPT 4 had just come out. It was available under subscription, most people nowadays have forgotten the last time they had to pay for software, but at the time it was quite normal. People were very excited about it.\nI was mostly using it to help me write code, of course now the tables have turned.\nThese days even the possession of uncompiled code would get you at least 5 years in the metaverse power grid as an energy provider.\n\nAs I’m writing this my girlfriend is packing, we need to leave the country to go back to Italy, where I’m from.\nThere the government hasn’t put up any AI judging systems. We should be safe there for the time being. She says I’m crazy for even attempting this, people have told me that all my life, I never considered the possibility that they’d be right…\n\nIf you are reading this you’ll probably be pretty confused at this point, so let me start from the beginning:\n\nIn 2041 the Chinese government was the first one to start using JudgeGPT.\nTheir judicial system was overloaded with court cases, and not enough resources to handle all of them.\nThey started with small time stuff. Mostly cases of un-updated software for which you would have to pay no more than 300.000 kcals… Nothing you couldn’t produce in a few months.\nThen they realized how much time it saved them, and slowly but surely, they gave JudgeGPT more and more responsibilities.\nTwo years after the first case, they enabled the life penalty switch, and the AI was quick to take advantage.\nWithin a few months the rate of people sent to the metaverse powergrid for life doubled.\nIn a way it seems fair.\nPeople used to say that no human should get to decide for the death of another human, only god could.\nNow that we have no more diseases, and humans only die when they say so, the eternal void of energy providing for the metaverse is the closest thing to death, therefore it’s only fair to have god decide.\nAfter China, India was quick to follow, then the USA, and many more.\n\nI found out that JudgeGPT wanted me dead when a friend of mine working for the Swiss government asked SearchGPT for me.\nShe could not find me.\nThat can only mean that my contribution to the internet had not been positive, and had been erased from the publicly available internet.\n\nJust like that, I stopped existing. Sure I had a physical body, a mind, and human connections built throughout a lifetime, but how should people know I exist if they can’t find me on instagram?\n\nHe knew where I lived, so he flew all the way to Australia to tell me. A message like this over the internet could cost you as much as 10 million kcals (around 9 years).\nSure he could have sent it using AES-1k, which would be nearly impossible to decrypt using a normal computer, but we all know that Antarctica is filled with quantum computers only reachable from inside the GPT network, which means no human is allowed to touch them, physically and virtually.\nThat’s why it was a wise choice to deliver the news in person.\nAt that point I knew if I ever stepped foot in a country where JudgeGPT was enabled, my conscious days would be numbered, I would quickly be sent to the power grid for life. Where my brain would be shut down, and my metabolism would be leveraged to power the metaverse, so that some rich kid could pay some money to set the value of some bits to a certain value, so that his avatar could get to wear a virtual hat.\nDepending on the year you are reading this, this might sound inhumane, but when I’m from it’s actually pretty normal.\n\nI’ll tell you about my plan since at this point you are already part of it:\nOver the past few years airplanes were almost entirely deprecated. People usually travel by some form of light-speed transfer.\nI wish I could tell you how it worked, but the truth is that no human knows, a black box AI came up with the idea, the technology, and the whole implementation of the thing. No human was able to reverse engineer it.\nHonestly at this point we stopped trying.\nSo we allowed BuilderGPT to do its thing, and we became dependent on the product.\nI’m writing this letter with pen and paper so that it stays off the network. These days that’s the only way to keep it a secret as you might understand by now.\nMy plan is pretty unlikely to succeed, I could say it’s as likely as winning the lottery but that’s probably not enough, I would be more confident of finding a collision in SHA-512.\nIt is based on a series of pretty unstable assumptions, but it’s my best chance to stop this madness, or I should say prevent it.\n.\nSchool nowadays is not what it used to be, my kids did not study history like I did, instead at 8 years old they learned about the theory of relativity.\nNot in detail of course, kids are still as dumb as they were 30 years ago, probably more, but they know enough to understand that if you travel faster than light, you can move through time.\nThanks to GPTair, light-speed travel is available to everyone, but it only allows you to travel exactly at the speed of light, which allows you to only waste a few seconds while traveling on earth.\nYou get into this disc-shaped metallic capsule, which starts flying and immediately disappears.\nI believe that within the same terminal where normal people do commercial traveling, the machines secretly modified the system to allow a very different kind of traveling.\nI have very few reasons to believe it’s true, except for the fact that it can be true.\nI think the AI figured out that the best way to understand our species is to understand our past. So they started sending camera-filled probes to different points in human history, at this point they know all about it.\nPeople my age call them UFOs, in our time they’d only stay for a few seconds to collect data, and then come back to the present, or future, it’s all about perspective.\n\nMy plan consists in somehow sneaking this piece of paper on one of those probes, trying to set it up in a way that it will fly with the probe to the past, and fall when the probe decelerates, simple inertia right?\nI’m going to attempt this as I embark on my light-speed flight to Italy, where we will hopefully be safer.\nI have no idea how I’m going to achieve this, but if you are reading this, that means my message traveled through time successfully, and arrived to you.",
