This is not my first solo travel, but it will be the longest. I remember the fear of being alone the first time I jumped on a plane to Barcelona by myself.\nI still feel that fear but I've grown to be used to it.

Most of those people are just like me: solo-travelers or just new to the city. \nThe first meet-up I'll tell you about was for software developers.\nThe appointment was in front of a building, there wasn't an address, just maps coordinates. I arrived an hour late, not for any particular reason, I was in my work flow and didn't want to interrupt it. So there I am, with nothing but some coordinates for a place where an hour ago some people met.\nI wasn't going to give up, the event was too perfect for me. I walked around a bit, and just around the corner was a huge glass door, on the other side was the writing of the company's name. \nThe name had the word 'technology' in it, so I thought that might have been the place. \nBefore I know it I'm reaching for the intercom, just before pressing the button I heard that voice inside my head... 'what the fuck are you doing', luckly another voice barged in saying 'what does it matter?' and so I rang.\nA french voice answered, didn't catch one word... I confidently replied with something like 'est le meet-up ici?', he said something and hung up.\nI thought: 'well, now I can leave knowing I tried'. But then I heard some noise from inside. The doorman getting up and coming to open the door. After a brief conversation including words from 3 different languages he walked me through a huge hall with white tall walls, and put me into an elevator, pressed a button and left.\nThe elevator's doors opened and I found a very french man staring at me. I was wearing my usual outfit, sport shorts that barely reached my half thigh, and a t-shirt.\nAs I walked in the room I became very aware of the dress code, after some poor conversation and a lot of weird looks from this roomful of french software developers, I sat down. The frenchman begun speaking again. His talk compared exagonal architecture with clean architecture. I understood bits and pieces here and there. \nThe ever-lasting feeling of non-belonging didn't matter, there was not one place in the world where I would have rather been than in that large yet unconfortable room.\nThe second evening was a bit more conventional if you will. The meet-up involved a picnic on the grass in the corner of \xeele de la cit\xe9. I passed by many big groups, but I felt like the biggest had to have been the one from the meet-up. I almost talked to them the first time I went by, but the voice... 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING?'. I kept walking. Got to the corner of the island, Spent two minutes silencing the voice, and came around. 'Etes-vous le du le meet-up?', I never got such a good response from such a poorly phrased question...\nThe organizer was so, so welcoming, he introduced me to everyone and I got to have 2 hours of french conversation. I could feel myself learning with every word I heard and said. Again, that was the best place I could have been in. Eventually I'll get to the point where the voice doesn't even come up, but until then, I'll just have to keep on fighting it."};t.default=r},function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n,o=new Date("2022-07-17"),i=o.getMonth()+1,r=i<10,s=(r?"0":null)+i.toString();n=(r=o.getDate()<10)?"0"+o.getDate().toString():o.getDate().toString();var l={key:2,title:"Small Paris",date:o.getFullYear()+"-"+s+"-"+n,content:"I was walking around Paris on a friday night. It was roughly 8pm. As the sun was setting, the air became clearer, giving the view from Pont de la Tournelle a dreamy look one can only hope to see with its own eyes.\nI kept walking for 10 minutes when I heard a voice calling my name. It was this Tunisian guy I met at a picnic 2 nights before, he was the organizer, and had made me feel very welcome. I'd later be reminded of his name: Mohamed. He was hanging out with two women, one of whom I had met at the picnic.\nThe world is so random, but somethings seem just too unlikely to be plain and simple coincidences.\nWe talked for a while, Mohamed was very smoothly trying to create simple conversations that could include me and my terrible french, then they told me they were going to go dance, and I was welcome to join.\nI normally dislike discos, so the question as to whether I was going to pay some crazy amount for the entrance to a parisian discotheque popped in my mind, I quickly the decided I wasn't going to, had that been the case.\nIt took a couple of minutes of walking to reach the place. The big crowd of people was the first thing I noticed. There was a semicircle of steps interrupted by the river. There was a lot of flat space inside the semicircle, not that you could see it, the dancing crowd was making good use of it. That place was made to allow boats to tie up, but thanks to its structure the acoustic was amazing. That beautiful dancing mass made the original goal seem worthless.\nWe walked past the first dancing semicircle. And stopped at the next one. They were playing salsa music. Mohamed indulged me to find a girl to dance with. I asked a tall blonde girl, she hesitantly said yes. I was awful, but she carried me through a dance. As I was going back to where the others were sitting, a girl asked me if I wanted to dance, that was a first.\nThis game of asking and dancing went on for a couple of hours, with a couple of rejection in between, I could not have cared less.\nAt some point I stopped, and stepped out of the semicircle to look around. It had gotten dark. I looked down at the dance floor, and saw this unique body of people, united in this rhythm that went 'uno dos tres ... uno dos tres', you couldn't help but feel the energy it radiated. Out of the blue, an incredible high of positive emotions, I chuckled as I kept looking at that moving body.\nWalking around I noticed there four semicircles in total, all of them were being put to use.\nI was hesitant to leave, similar to surfing, before going out of the water, you always want one last wave. I danced once more, and said goodbye, 'Je pars, bonne nuit'. I walked to the metro as a huge yellow moon rose from behind notre dame.\nI really want to learn to dance."};t.default=l},function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n,o=new Date("2022-07-25"),i=o.getMonth()+1,r=i<10,s=(r?"0":null)+i.toString();n=(r=o.getDate()<10)?"0"+o.getDate().toString():o.getDate().toString();var l={key:3,title:"The stand-up comedy nights",date:o.getFullYear()+"-"+s+"-"+n,content:"I had walked past big and small, expensive, and very expensive caf\xe9s and bars before reaching my destination. There wasn't even a counter, just some tables on the side of a very rectangular room, and a door, possibly taking you to the kitchen. I sat down with the people from the meet-up and after chatting for sometime, the host, Anna, took us upstairs, where the show would be. Shaped exactly like the one downstairs, the room was tightly filled with rows of 3 chairs on each side.\nIt was my first comedy show, the first rows where empty, so I and two girls who I had met downstairs sat in the first row, I have mixed feelings about that decision.\nI did not know stand-up comedians interacted so much with the audience, it was more than enough to give me stage fright. So after an hour of extreme self-awareness, an hilarious show, and too many unfortunate answers to the teasing of the comedians, everyone got up and left.\nThe 3rd comedian, an extremely talented american, was hanging out by the stairs. I paid him some compliments about his show, and got to talking with the group. It was a group of 6 people, and we decided to look for a place to get something to drink.\nWe talked about all the things people talk about when they first meet, with some sparks of interesting conversation here and there. We all really enjoyed each other's company and agreed to see each other the night after, as Alexander was going to do another show.\nThe following night was also fun, I spent it with very different people. After the show the same things happened. I ended up sitting in front of, and next to, two ladies, both stand-up comedians, both somewhere between their late 30s and their early 40s. I liked neither of them. During the little time I got to spend with them, they complained for most of it, about various things. My opinion is that it's okay to dislike people, but that shouldn't prevent you from learning something out of them. You obviously can't do that if you let your dislike for them show too much.\nA very cool lesson I learned from those days is that you can make anything funny. Allow your mind to be free to create, or partially create funny stuff out of normal scenarios, and you never know what might come of it. Life also makes it pretty easy, I don't know about you but funny things happen to me all the time, you just need to see them from the right perspective."};t.default=l},function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n,o=new Date("2022-08-07"),i=o.getMonth()+1,r=i<10,s=(r?"0":null)+i.toString();n=(r=o.getDate()<10)?"0"+o.getDate().toString():o.getDate().toString();var l={key:4,title:"Single Serving Friends",date:o.getFullYear()+"-"+s+"-"+n,content:"I decided to write about this on one of my last nights in Paris. A beautiful girl named Jeanne had told all about her passion for techno.

I bonded so much with them, and I will probably never see any of them again.\nThen I think about my long term friends, whom I share so many experiences with. Who I know so well I know how they will react to all the stories I tell them. Sometimes life with them gets difficult because when you know someone that well, you are familiar with their faults, and you just have to make peace with them. Still I need those relationships. Because life without them is just a series of short chapters you can't piece together in the book of your life.\nI'm still looking for my way of balancing the two. Its hard to maintain the same contact with long term friends while solo traveling, I almost feel like I have to choose between the two.\nLife with single serving friends is so intense you can't help but being in love with life. And yet the only memories you are left with after a while, are the ones with your long term friends.\nAs always with life, the answer is neither one nor zero. Not black nor white.

We biked for 3 hours to get there, stayed a couple of hours, and came back.\nWhen Claudio left I went to Honfleur, crossing the Pont de Normandie. Got a couple of runner's high on the way, which was weird, I usually only get them when I run.\nHere in Caen I finally have a good bike, it's very light and allows me to go incredibly fast. Yesterday I went to Cabourg (60k). Today I followed 'la route verte suisse normande' and some more (50k). And tomorrow I'm going to bike for 80k passing all the biggest beaches of normandy, where the invasion of normandy happened.\nDoes it feel good all the time? Fuck no. I couldn't wait to be home on the way back today. But I just love spending time in a flow state. There is nothing more relaxing to me then doing a mindless activity for hours and hours, your mind goes all over the place. It provides a great excuse for introspection, which is very important to me.\nMost people can't stand the thought of being bythemselves in silence, they need to fill that void with music, podcasts, other people. I partly do what I do to try to distance myself as much as possible from that. Every human should be comfortable in their own headspace, but all this probably deserves another post.\nI have been meeting so many bike travelers the idea of doing it myself is starting to sound exciting. I'm writing it just to make it more real. How great would it be to cycle back from Paris to Palermo?

Habits are the reason I am the student, athlete, developer, polyglot, and the person I am today.\nI'm pretty good at building habit, and that's all I do.\nBut I believe we should accept and welcome change, a life filled with habits provides little to no new experiences, or room for deep personal growth. Which is why I'm taking this break. Allowing myself to live in a habitless time.\nI wake up in a different place every few days, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with the day.

Honestly I miss spending all day studying, only to break to go to the gym, then study more, and then go to bed to do it all over again.
